Headspring-Live-Coding-Exercise
===============================

Features:
Web Requests
Pull-to-refresh
Search bar
Cell animation
Details are in scroll view so everything bounces (UIs that you can't interact with don't
feel right)

Things I would work on with more time:

- Autolayout - This was giving me a ton of trouble so I only supported Portrait mode. I 
wanted the user's name to be lower on the details page, but for some reason everything 
is shifting down in the scroll view.

- Better looking way to present skills - Possibly a more accordion-style animation

Overall, I found it a bit difficult to be creative with the presentation given how little
data there was. I do something very similar to this app in my Async-Web-Request-Project 
repo but that API gave me more data to work with.
